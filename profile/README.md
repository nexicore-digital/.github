**Modular tools for developers who want to learn, build, and own their data workflows—with clarity, control, and confidence.**

Welcome to **Nexicore Digitals**—a software company focused on empowering developers through educational UX, controlled automation, and transparent error reporting. Our tools help users ingest, shape, validate, and expose data across the stack, with guidance from our AI agent, **Nexi**.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- 🧩 **Modular by design** — Each tool stands alone or plugs into others. Use what you need, skip what you don’t.
- 🧠 **Educational UX** — Dev Mode and General Mode let users choose how deep they go.
- 🛡️ **Controlled automation** — Guardrails ensure users stay in control while learning.
- 🧯 **Error reporting as a teacher** — We turn mistakes into insights, not frustration.
